UWMRT is a repository that contains all the code that the UWMRT uses. In order for any of the projects to be useful, you must first set up the "lib" folder for use. In order to do so in the Arduino IDE, you must go to Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library, and select the "lib" folder.

If you want to start a new project make sure to start it within the "project" dir. If you want to create a new library, start it within the "lib" dir.
